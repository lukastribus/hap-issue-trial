Welcome! - We kindly ask that you:

  1. Fill out the issue template below - not doing so needs a good reason.
  2. Use the forum or the mailing list if you have a question rather than a bug or feature request.

The forum is at: https://discourse.haproxy.org/

The mailing list (no need to subscribe) is: haproxy@formilux.org
Subscribe to the list: haproxy+subscribe@formilux.org
Unsubscribe from the list: haproxy+unsubscribe@formilux.org

Forum and mailing list are correct places for questions about HAProxy or general suggestions
and topics, e.g. usage or documentation questions! This issue tracker is for tracking bugs and
feature requests directly relating to the development of the software itself.

Thanks for understanding, and for contributing to the project!
